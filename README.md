Terrible Python code for generating sounds for Mathematics: In Sound Only! This is a project I've begun for Summer of Math Exposition 2025, but I want to keep it going anyway.

The sounds, which are not as terrible as the code that produced them, are here:

DirtySoundGenerator produces a series of sync'd clicks that ramp up gradually into tones. If you play any pair of these together, you can hear a rhythmic relationship become a tonal relationship (which is the point of it).

The other one just makes various Pythagorean and even tuned scales.
